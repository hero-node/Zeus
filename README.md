# Zeus
Decentralized cross platform app using Ethereum and the ipfs network
Why?

We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication.

No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is serving it.

No hosting costs: Sites are served by decentralized nodes.

Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
